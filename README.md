# OpeningHoursFixer
Fix `opening_hours` syntax in OSM data.

This uses the errors found by Osmose as a TODO list,
and uses https://invent.kde.org/libraries/kopeninghours for the parsing and reformatting,
and then lets the user manually review the changes, and fix by hand what the parser failed to understand.
